-Hi, I'm Luke

-I'm interested in a lot of different things but a few include lifting weights, reading, playing the guitar, and programming

-Currently, I'm learning how to code in python and java, java is more in school as I'm working on a computer science degree,
but I do python in my free time

-Right now, I'm not sure what to collaborate on as I'm still learning how to program better and at a higher level

-You can reach me at my email, lukecrouse264@gmail.com
